    "        <li>Code cells have boxes around them. When you hover over them an <i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i> icon appears.</li>\n",
    "        <li>To run a code cell either click the <i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i> icon, or click on the cell and then hit <b>Shift+Enter</b>. The <b>Shift+Enter</b> combo will also move you to the next cell, so it's a quick way to work through the notebook.</li>\n",
    "        <li>While a cell is running a <b>*</b> appears in the square brackets next to the cell. Once the cell has finished running the asterisk will be replaced with a number.</li>\n",
    "        <li>In most cases you'll want to start from the top of notebook and work your way down running each cell in turn. Later cells might depend on the results of earlier ones.</li>\n",
    "        <li>To edit a code cell, just click on it and type stuff. Remember to run the cell once you've finished editing.</li>\n",
